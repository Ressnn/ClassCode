|Making a variable and storing a value in it|

To make a variable and store values in it in python
type in variable_name = value

Essentially this will tell python to make a box with
the label variable_name and to fill it with value

the = sign is also called an assignment operator and the
variable to the right is assigned what is to the left
"""
x=1
x=5

"""
|Storing Numbers|
To store numbers in python just type set the value on the
right side of the assignment operator to a number
"""
x=3.14
print(x)

"""
|Storing Text (Strings)|
To store text put quotes around the text and then assign it to a variable
"""
x="Hello World"
print(x)
"""
There are some charecters that can't be put into strings directly like the quotes
themselves so we use \" to denote a quote
"""
print("Hello \' World'")

"""
Like this we also have some other special charecters that are handled
seperatley like the ones below
\n - > newline
\t -> tab
\\ -> inserts backslash
"""

print("Hello\nWorld")

"""
|Storing Booleans(True/False)|
To store booleans set the value on the right of the assignment operator to
either True or False
"""

print(value)
