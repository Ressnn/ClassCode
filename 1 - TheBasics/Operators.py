"""Now lets talk about some operators that are useful in coding"""



"""
|Numerical Operators|
If the data stored in a variable is a number the following operations apply
add - > +
subtract -> -
multiply -> *
divide -> /
exponents -> **
more operations are possible but require the math import
"""
a = 3
b = 7
a*b
a-b
a/b
a*b
a**b

"""
|String Operators|
Strings by default can be added together
"""
a = "Hello\n"
b = "World"
print(a+b)
"""
You can also index a string to take part of it
it works like so String_Name[Start:Stop:Step]

0 1 2 3 4 5
|H|e|l|l|o|
"""

myString = "Hello World"
print(myString[::-1])
print(myString[3:5:])

"""
|Boolean Operators|
A booleans only operator is the not operator
"""
a = True
print(a)
